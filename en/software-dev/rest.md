# REST API

## Introduction

::: tip

A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. ... REST technology is generally preferred to the more robust Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology because REST leverages less bandwidth, making it more suitable for internet usage.
