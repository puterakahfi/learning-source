![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/Use_case_restaurant_model.svg/220px-Use_case_restaurant_model.svg.png)


A use case diagram at its simplest is a representation of a user's interaction with the system that shows the relationship between the user and the different use cases in which the user is involved. A use case diagram can identify the different types of users of a system and the different use cases and will often be accompanied by other types of diagrams as well. The use cases are represented by either circles or ellipses.
