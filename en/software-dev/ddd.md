## Concept


### Domain

- [What is the Domain Model in Domain Driven Design?](https://culttt.com/2014/11/12/domain-model-domain-driven-design/)

#### Domain Event

- [Implementing Domain Event](https://culttt.com/2014/09/22/implementing-domain-events/)

### Entity

::: tip
One of the main characteristics of an entity is that it has an identity. The identity never changes through the life cycle of an entity.

### Bounded Context

::: tip

Bounded Context is a central pattern in Domain-Driven Design. It is the focus of DDD's strategic design section which is all about dealing with large models and teams. DDD deals with large models by dividing them into different Bounded Contexts and being explicit about their interrelationships.
