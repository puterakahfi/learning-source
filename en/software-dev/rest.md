# REST API

## Introduction

> A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. ... REST technology is generally preferred to the more robust Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology because REST leverages less bandwidth, making it more suitable for internet usage.

### REST API Confusing Parts

#### What different between REST and RESTfull

> Representational state transfer (REST) is a style of software architecture. As described in a dissertation by Roy Fielding, REST is an "architectural style" that basically exploits the existing technology and protocols of the Web. RESTful is typically used to refer to web services implementing such an architecture.

### PUT vs PATCH

> update a Resource via PUT method and a partial update using PATCH.
